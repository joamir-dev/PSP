## About

The Parker Solar Probe is a historic space mission developed by NASA to investigate the Sun's corona, the outermost layer of its atmosphere. By passing closer to the Sun than any previous spacecraft, the Parker Solar Probe is collecting unprecedented data to improve our understanding of solar wind, space weather, and other phenomena. This mission has the potential to transform our knowledge of the Sun and its influence on the entire solar system.

## Mission Overview

- **Launch Date**: August 12, 2018
- **Spacecraft**: Parker Solar Probe
- **Launch Vehicle**: Delta IV Heavy
- **Primary Mission Objective**: To gather data from the Sunâ€™s corona and solar wind, improving our understanding of space weather and its effects on Earth and other planetary bodies.
- **Closest Approach**: The Parker Solar Probe will come within 3.83 million miles of the Sun, far closer than any previous spacecraft.

### Key Mission Goals:
1. **Trace the flow of energy and understand the structure of the solar corona.**
2. **Understand the acceleration of the solar wind.**
3. **Explore the magnetic fields around the Sun.**
4. **Investigate the origins of solar energetic particles (SEPs).**

## Key Instruments

The Parker Solar Probe is equipped with a suite of scientific instruments designed to study the Sunâ€™s atmosphere and solar wind in detail.

### 1. **FIELDS**
   - Measures the electric and magnetic fields surrounding the Sun.
   
### 2. **WISPR (Wide-Field Imager for Parker Solar Probe)**
   - Captures images of the solar corona and solar wind.

### 3. **SWEAP (Solar Wind Electrons Alphas and Protons)**
   - Measures the properties of solar wind particles.
   
### 4. **ISÊ˜IS (Integrated Science Investigation of the Sun)**
   - Measures high-energy solar particles such as electrons, protons, and heavier ions.

These instruments work together to provide comprehensive data on the Sun's behavior and the solar wind.

## Data Access

### Data Release
The Parker Solar Probe mission releases its scientific data through NASAâ€™s Planetary Data System (PDS). Data from the mission will be available for free to the public as it is collected and processed.

- [PDS Archive](https://pds.nasa.gov/)
- [Parker Solar Probe Mission Data Portal](https://parkersolarprobe.jhuapl.edu/)

### Data Formats
The data is typically provided in FITS (Flexible Image Transport System) and other standard formats for easy integration with data analysis software.

## Installation

To explore the Parker Solar Probe mission data and visualizations, you can install the necessary tools and dependencies using the following commands.

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/nasa/parkersolarprobe.git
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   If you're looking to analyze the data and build visualizations:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Access Data**:
   Follow the instructions on the [NASA PDS portal](https://pds.nasa.gov/) to download and manage data locally.

## Usage

After setting up the environment, you can begin exploring the mission data. The tools included in this repository allow you to visualize solar wind speeds, magnetic field variations, solar particle events, and other key aspects of the Sunâ€™s behavior.

Here is a simple example of how to process and visualize Parker Solar Probe's data:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import pandas as pd

# Load data from a CSV file obtained from NASA's PDS
data = pd.read_csv('parkersolarprobe_data.csv')

# Plot solar wind speed vs time
plt.plot(data['Time'], data['Solar Wind Speed'])
plt.xlabel('Time (days)')
plt.ylabel('Solar Wind Speed (km/s)')
plt.title('Solar Wind Speed Over Time')
plt.show()
```

For more advanced use cases, consult the provided documentation and Jupyter notebooks within the repository for specific analysis workflows.
